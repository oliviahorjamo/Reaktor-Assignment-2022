# Reaktor-Assignment-2022
This repository contains my solution for the Reaktor Software Developer Trainee, Autumn 2022 [pre-assignment](https://www.reaktor.com/assignment-fall-2022-developers/).

------------

Some Python projects use Poetry to manage dependencies. Poetry uses a file called poetry.lock to record which packages a project needs and which dependencies those packages have. Here is an example of such a file.

Write a small program in your language of choice that accepts a poetry.lock file as input and exposes some key information about the packages via an HTML user interface.

------------

My implementation of the assignment is testable on [Heroku](https://poetry-lock-parser-app.herokuapp.com/).
